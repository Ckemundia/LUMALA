LUMALA: AI-Powered Learning Platform
LUMALA is an innovative, web-based study tool designed to transform passive academic content into interactive learning experiences. Developed specifically to support students at KCA University, the platform leverages Artificial Intelligence to turn complex academic questions into simple explanations, video summaries, flashcards, and quizzes.

## Project Overview
Traditional self-study often involves wading through dense PDFs and long lecture slides, leading to cognitive overload. LUMALA addresses this by providing:

Instant AI Explanations: Real-time, simplified answers to complex academic queries.

Multi-Format Revision: Automated generation of study materials from a single input.

Engagement-First Design: Interactive tools like clickable flashcards and instant-feedback quizzes.

## Key Features
AI Answer Engine: Type or paste a question to receive a concise, accurate explanation.

Video Summaries: Short, visual-style breakdowns of concepts to support the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning.

Active Recall Tools: * Flashcards: Key-point cards for quick memorization.

Quizzes: Instant multiple-choice questions to test mastery.

User-Centric Dashboard: A clean, modern interface (built with React and Tailwind CSS) designed for low cognitive load.

## Technical Stack
The project is built using a modern web development stack to ensure speed and scalability:

Frontend: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS

Backend: (e.g., Node.js / Python Fast API)

AI Integration: Large Language Models (LLMs) for content generation.

Version Control: Git

## Theoretical Foundation
The development of LUMALA is grounded in established educational theories:

Cognitive Load Theory: Reducing "mental noise" by breaking down information.

Constructivist Learning: Encouraging students to actively engage with materials rather than just reading.

Multimedia Learning: Combining text and visuals for better mental model construction.

## Installation & Setup
To run a local instance of the LUMALA frontend:

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lumala.git
Navigate to the directory:

Bash
cd lumala
Install dependencies:

Bash
npm install
Run the development server:

Bash
npm run dev
## Limitations
Requires active internet access.

Accuracy is dependent on the underlying AI model's training data.

Designed as a supplementary tool, not a replacement for university lecturers.
